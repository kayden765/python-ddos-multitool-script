## OVERVIEW

MAINFRAME is a comprehensive security reconnaissance and testing platform designed for authorized security assessments, penetration testing, and educational purposes. It provides a unified terminal interface for network analysis, OSINT gathering, local system auditing, and controlled attack vector testing.

The tool is organized into five primary operational directories, each containing specialized modules for different aspects of security testing.

```

### Key Design Principles

- **Modular Architecture:** Each attack/recon module is isolated in its own directory under `core/`
- **Lazy Imports:** Optional modules are imported independently so missing dependencies don't break the entire tool
- **Dual-Stream Logging:** All terminal output is simultaneously logged to disk
- **Cross-Platform:** Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS with platform-specific optimizations
- **Auto-Elevation:** Automatically requests Administrator/Root privileges on Windows when needed

---

## INSTALLATION

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (for cloning)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kayden765/python-ddos-multitool-script.git
cd cybertool

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Complete Setup (Recommended)

Run `setup.bat` as Administrator to automatically install all Python dependencies and external tools:

```bash
setup.bat
```

This will:
- Install all Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Install **Impacket** (`psexec.py` / `wmiexec.py`) via pip
- Download `psexec.py` and `wmiexec.py` to `core/impacket_scripts/`
- Install **Chocolatey** if not present
- Install **Hashcat** via Chocolatey
- Install **Metasploit Framework** (`msfconsole` / `msfvenom`) via Chocolatey
- Verify all installations and report status

### Manual External Tool Installation

If `setup.bat` does not cover your platform, install these tools manually:

| Tool | Purpose | Install Method |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Impacket** | Administrative remoting (`psexec.py`, `wmiexec.py`) | `pip install impacket` |
| **Hashcat** | Password compliance auditing | Download from https://hashcat.net/hashcat/ |
| **Metasploit Framework** | `msfconsole` / `msfvenom` | Download from https://www.metasploit.com/download |
| **Nmap** | Advanced port scanning and service profiling | `choco install nmap` or download from https://nmap.org/ |
| **Sherlock** | Username tracing | `pip install sherlock-project` |
| **PhoneInfoga** | Telecom scanning | Requires Go: `go install github.com/sundowndev/phoneinfoga@latest` |
| **Holehe** | Email platform auditor | `pip install holehe` |
| **Socialscan** | Identity profiler | `pip install socialscan` |

Ensure all installed tools are in your system `PATH` so `mainframe.py` can locate them.

### Sub-Directory 05 — Defensive Auditing Tools Installation

The following 5 tools were added to Sub-Directory 05 for defensive auditing and baseline validation:

#### 1. Metasploit Framework Console (`msfconsole`)
- **Purpose:** Systems administrators use msfconsole to validate known infrastructure configurations, test network boundaries against documented service behaviors, and confirm patch integrity through controlled exploitation modules in isolated lab environments.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows: Download the official installer from https://www.metasploit.com/download
  - Or use Chocolatey: `choco install metasploit`
  - After installation, ensure `msfconsole` and `msfvenom` are in your system `PATH`
- **Verification:** Run `msfconsole --version` to confirm installation

#### 2. Msfvenom Network Egress Verification Tool (`msfvenom`)
- **Purpose:** Generates synthetic network communication payloads to test whether internal IDS and corporate firewalls successfully alert on or block abnormal outbound connections.
- **Installation:** Bundled with Metasploit Framework. Install Metasploit as described above.
- **Verification:** Run `msfvenom --help` to confirm installation

#### 3. Hashcat Password-Strength Compliance Auditor (`hashcat`)
- **Purpose:** Offline cryptographic verification core used to cross-reference enterprise database hashes against common dictionary lists, ensuring internal passwords adhere to corporate complexity standards.
- **Installation:**
  - Windows: Download from https://hashcat.net/hashcat/
  - Or use Chocolatey: `choco install hashcat`
  - Extract the archive and add the directory to your system `PATH`
- **Verification:** Run `hashcat --version` to confirm installation

#### 4. Impacket Administrative Remoting Suite (`psexec.py` / `wmiexec.py`)
- **Purpose:** Evaluates local credential hygiene, auditing whether standard enterprise service accounts have excessive implicit cross-network permissions or misconfigured access tokens.
- **Installation:**
  - Install via pip: `pip install impacket`
  - The mainframe automatically downloads `psexec.py` and `wmiexec.py` from the official Impacket repository to `core/impacket_scripts/`
  - No additional PATH configuration needed; the mainframe resolves these scripts automatically
- **Verification:** Run `python -c "from impacket import version; print(version.__version__)"` to confirm the library is installed

#### 5. Real-Time Security Log Diagnostic Module
- **Purpose:** Defensive telemetry module used to tail, read, and stream local audit text logs and session history outputs to the operator in real time.
- **Installation:** No external dependencies required. This is a pure-Python module built into `mainframe.py`.
- **Verification:** Select option [8] from Sub-Directory 05 and provide a valid log file path to test streaming.

## IMAGE LOGGER — VERCEl DEPLOYMENT

The Image Logger can be deployed to Vercel for a public URL that works everywhere, including Discord.

### How It Works

1. **Deployment:** Mainframe auto-deploys `core/vercel-image-logger/` to Vercel
2. **Public URL:** Generates a shareable `https://*.vercel.app` link
3. **Tracking:** When someone opens the link:
    - Their IP address is logged
    - User-Agent and timestamp are captured
    - Data is stored in Vercel's ephemeral `/tmp` storage
4. **Monitoring:** Mainframe terminal polls `/api/logs` and displays captures in real-time
5. **Image Preview:** The page serves a GIF directly as `image/gif` for proper Discord preview

### Technical Details

- **Framework:** Vercel Node.js Serverless Function
- **Image:** `https://c.tenor.com/HtRab3iYiisAAAAC/tenor.gif`
- **Logs Endpoint:** `https://vercel-image-logger.vercel.app/api/logs`
- **Response Format:** Direct binary GIF with caching disabled
- **OG Tags:** Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social previews

### Local vs Vercel

| Feature | Local Server | Vercel Deployment |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| URL | `localhost:8080` | `*.vercel.app` |
| Discord Preview | Limited | Full image preview |
| Accessibility | Local only | Public internet |
| Logs | In-memory | Vercel `/tmp` (ephemeral) |
| Monitoring | Live terminal | Live terminal via API |

---

## LOGGING & PRIVACY

### Session Logging

MAINFRAME implements dual-stream logging:
- All terminal output is captured to `logs/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
- Logs are written in real-time as the tool runs
- ANSI color codes are stripped from log files for readability

### Privacy Protection

To protect your privacy when sharing this tool:

1. **Logs Directory:** The `logs/` folder is gitignored
2. **No IP Storage:** The Vercel image logger does not store logs locally
3. **Ephemeral Storage:** Vercel serverless functions use temporary storage
4. **Session Isolation:** Each run creates a new timestamped log file
5. **Input Directory:** The `core/input/` folder is gitignored to prevent accidental commit of wordlists, tokens, or IP lists

### What Gets Logged

- Terminal output from all modules
- Image logger captures (Vercel only, not local)
- Session start/stop timestamps
- Error messages and stack traces

### What Does NOT Get Logged

- Your personal IP address (unless you test with yourself)
- Credentials or passwords entered during brute force
- Target information from recon modules
- Any data from the `core/input/` directory

---

## CONFIGURATION & CUSTOMIZATION

### Wordlist Configuration

The Brute Force module automatically uses:
```
core/input/brutef.txt
```

Place your custom wordlist at this path. One password per line.

### Language Settings

Access settings via the main menu or directly in `core/etc/settings.py`:
- Language preferences (EN/RU)
- Color schemes

### Module Paths

All modules are loaded from `core/` with independent imports. To disable a module:
1. Delete or rename its folder under `core/`
2. The mainframe will skip it gracefully with a "not loaded" message
